Meet James, the Discord Bot made specifically for the Endless Sky Server.

## Installation
### Requirements
- A JDK (recommended Java 8 or better)
- gradle on Linux, on áº‚indows use depr_gradlew.bat instead
- Python and the [requests module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
### Setup
1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Using the Discord API, make a new Bot and save the "bot token" as token.txt in James' top-level directory (follow [this guide](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki/3%29-Getting-Started) until "2. Setup JDA Project")
3. Get missing API keys. Some commands (Such as the wav conversion) won't run without these keys. See 'keys.txt' for more
4. Replace the 'HOST_RAW_URL' and 'HOST_PUBLIC_URL' and 'CONTENT_URL' strings with relevant URL destinations
5. Start James by executing `gradle run` or `depr_gradlew run`. *Note: if you get an error about missing parentheses, you most likely run python3 as standart python exectubale. Either install python2.7 or, on linux, replace 'python' in build.gradle with 'python2.7'*
